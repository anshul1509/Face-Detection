# Face Detection with Python using OpenCV.

This tutorial will introduce you to the concept of object detection in Python using OpenCV library and how you can utilize it to perform tasks like Facial detection.

These algorithms also need to be fed many training samples comprising different lighting, angles, and orientations to make correct predictions in real-world scenarios.

These nuances make face detection a non-trivial, time-consuming task that requires hours of model training and millions of data samples.
